            <p style={{fontFamily: 'Agrandir', color: '#2b73ff', fontSize: '16px', margin: '6vh 0px', padding: '15px', borderStyle: 'solid'}}>When I was 12, I moved from Fremont in Silicon Valley, where tech is the most popular career path for students my age, to London. I found that many of my classmates did not choose computer science or even STEM related subjects, and opted for arts and humanities instead. When asked, they said taking computer science was boring and meant they needed to sit in front of computers all day. This baffled me. I felt there was a gap in understanding of what career choices are available in technology companies. Software is eating the world, and in the next 10 years, I see the majority of jobs being tech jobs. Software is what will set us up to be valuable contributors to society. So I founded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu0JDwHERzummolFlZlTUvw">Tech Beyond College</a>, a youtube channel whose goal is to demystify what working in tech looks like, and create awareness of the variety of jobs that are available in tech companies by interviewing amazing women that I know. You donâ€™t all have to code in front of a computer all day. The future is bright.&nbsp;</p>
